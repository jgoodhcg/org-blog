# Blogroll and Directory Discovery

## Problem / Intent

To increase the visibility of the blog and connect with the wider blogging community. This involves both linking to other blogs (blogroll) and listing this blog in various "slashpage" directories.

## Constraints

None currently.

## Proposed Approach

1.  **Create a Blogroll/Links Page:** Add a dedicated page or a section to the site to list and link to other interesting blogs.
2.  **Submit to Directories:** Systematically submit `org-blog` to relevant directories.

## Open Questions

- Should the blogroll be a standalone page (`/links`) or part of an existing page (like `home` or `about`)?
