# 2026-02-01

## Goal

Setup agent context, update project conventions to match `AGENT_BLUEPRINT.md`, and establish logging/decision tracking.

## Summary

Refactored `AGENTS.md` and the entire `roadmap/` directory to adhere to the new `AGENT_BLUEPRINT.md` standards. This involved adding YAML frontmatter to all roadmap items, restructuring the `roadmap/index.md` and `roadmap/README.md`, and standardizing the workflow definitions in `AGENTS.md`. Established the `.decisions` and `.logs` directories for future artifacts.

## Changes

- `AGENTS.md`: Updated to blueprint template with project-specific overrides.
- `roadmap/index.md`: Refactored to new hub structure.
- `roadmap/_template.md`: Updated with standard frontmatter.
- `roadmap/*.md`: All existing roadmap items updated with frontmatter and standard sections.
- `.logs/2026-02-01.md`: Created first log entry.
- `.decisions/`: Created directory for future decision records.
- `roadmap/archived/resume-update.md`: Archived work unit; content complete, visual items skipped.
- `src/org_blog/pages/snapshots.clj`: Implemented static infinite scroll feed for "snapshot" posts.
- `src/org_blog/pages/home.clj`: Filtered "snapshot" posts from main feed.
- `e2e/tests/snapshots.spec.ts`: Added smoke test for stream page.
- `roadmap/archived/project-snapshots.md`: Completed.

## Open

- Design system setup (deferred per instructions).
