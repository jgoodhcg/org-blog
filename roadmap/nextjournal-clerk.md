# Nextjournal Clerk for Data-Rich Posts

## Work Unit Summary

- **Status:** idea
- **Problem/Intent:** Enable data-rich, interactive posts/pages (charts, tables, notebooks) beyond static Markdown.
- **Constraints:** Keep the site static-first; avoid adding a runtime server dependency or a heavy build pipeline.
- **Proposed Approach:** Evaluate `nextjournal/clerk` for static HTML export and define how Clerk artifacts would flow into `posts/` or `pages/` alongside current Pandoc/Hiccup rendering.
- **Open Questions:** How to integrate Clerk output with existing templates/styles? How to manage assets and caching? What authoring workflow fits current Markdown posts?
