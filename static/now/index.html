<p>What I'm up to right now.</p>
<h2 id="health">ü•ï Health</h2>
<p>I'm in my early 30s and I think my top focus for the rest of my life
should be health and longevity. Most of the influence in this space
comes from two sources:</p>
<h3 id="how-not-to-die">How not to die</h3>
<p>The website <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/">nutritionfacts.org</a> is the biggest
influence. A doctor reviews nutrition and medical journals and distills
the findings into content for regular people. tl;dr ‚Ä¶ eat whole food
plant based and your chance of dying from virtually every major risk
factor decreases. I bought <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-die-cookbook/">the
cookbook</a> and have been trying to make that a majority of my diet.
I'm still regularly consuming dairy and eggs but consumption is trending
down.</p>
<h3 id="blueprint">Blueprint</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bryanjohnson.com/">Bryan Johnson</a> is becoming
a tech bro celebrity with his quantitative measured approach to
anti-aging. I want to avoid death as much as possible and also like to
nerd out about numbers. I've been watching all the content he puts out
about the Blueprint protocol since I found out about it. I've adopted
some aspects of it into my own diet and exercise.</p>
<h3 id="my-protocol">My protocol</h3>
<p>It's not consistent enough but I have some thins I'm trying to
do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat whole food plant based as much as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>I let myself be <em>pescatarian</em> when I eat out. And occasionally
I'll indulge in dairy at home. But I try to at least start my day out
well with the Green Giant and Super Veggie from Blueprint protocol. I
also have been experimenting with meals from the How Not to Die
Cookbook.</p>
<ul>
<li>Work out once a day</li>
</ul>
<p>I average 3 times a week. Ideally the workouts are just under an hour
and full body. There are lots of physical therapy like movements in my
routine to counteract some issues I've developed from sitting too
much.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a multivitamin</li>
</ul>
<p>I like Thorne 2 a day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to stop eating by 5pm</li>
</ul>
<p>This one is the hardest to stick to.</p>
<h2 id="production">üõ†Ô∏è Production</h2>
<h3 id="lo-mirli">Lo Mirli</h3>
<p>Not launched as of now.</p>
<h3 id="garden">Garden</h3>
<p>I think monoculture grass yards should not exist. Our greenspaces
should try to elevate biodiversity. Food production should also shift
from centralized factory production to decentralized local
production.</p>
<p>I've converted my entire front and back yard into a growing space for
fruits, vegetables, and flowers. I've been in my current house for three
growing seasons and the space is evolving as I learn from experience and
from consuming content.</p>
<p>My main goal for the upcoming 2024 season is to eradicate perennial
grasses by using ground cover the whole growing season. That means I'll
be limited to growing in fabric pots on top of the ground cover until
next season.</p>
<h2 id="intentional-consumption">üëÄ Intentional Consumption</h2>
<h3 id="farming">Farming</h3>
<p>I'm still harboring a fantasy of quitting tech and becoming a
farmer.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/REDGardens">Red Gardens</a></li>
</ul>
<p>High signal quantitative and qualitative analysis of multiple
gardening techniques in Ireland.</p>

</ul>
<p>Consumption thoughtful nursery and composting system in New York
state.</p>

</ul>
<p>High production value no-till related.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.notillgrowers.com/the-composter">The

</ul>
<p>A podcast interviewing different <em>high quality compost</em>
operations.</p>
<h3 id="wantrepreneur">Wantrepreneur</h3>
<p>Since I started writing software professionally I've consumed
entrepreneur content. This is the stuff I like the most.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.startuptolast.com/">Startup to Last</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My favorite &quot;two people talking&quot; show about <em>bootstrappy</em> tech
companies. I listen to a few shows like this ‚Äì too many to list here. So
I'll just mention this one. I think these two most align with my values
and are just constantly talking about things I find interesting.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcasts">Indie
Hackers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Courtland is a really good podcast host. Early episodes are interview
style. I've listened to each episode two or three times. Later episodes
are more conversational. This is just a good resource to get immersed
and have the basics reiterated over and over.</p>
<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>I'm becoming more interested in urbanism and climate change and I
like these sources of information.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CityNerd">City Nerd</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The common themes are walkability, density, and public
transportation. Lots of deadpan humor and sarcasm. Also deep
quantitative dives and qualitative first hand accounts of experiences
across cities in the United States.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNZYWyBGJ1GLPmb55WQAln2Q7rZn5AFX">PBS
Terra - Weathered</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Non alarmist, but still alarming, generally accessible explanations
of climate change topics. I watch these to feel better about living in
the midwest.</p>
