# 2026-02-01

## Goal

Setup agent context, update project conventions to match `AGENT_BLUEPRINT.md`, and establish logging/decision tracking.

## Summary

Refactored `AGENTS.md` and the entire `roadmap/` directory to adhere to the new `AGENT_BLUEPRINT.md` standards. This involved adding YAML frontmatter to all roadmap items, restructuring the `roadmap/index.md` and `roadmap/README.md`, and standardizing the workflow definitions in `AGENTS.md`. Established the `.decisions` and `.logs` directories for future artifacts.

## Changes

- `AGENTS.md`: Updated to blueprint template with project-specific overrides.
- `roadmap/index.md`: Refactored to new hub structure.
- `roadmap/_template.md`: Updated with standard frontmatter.
- `roadmap/*.md`: All existing roadmap items updated with frontmatter and standard sections.
- `.logs/2026-02-01.md`: Created first log entry.
- `.decisions/`: Created directory for future decision records.

## Open

- Resume update (active work unit).
- Design system setup (deferred per instructions).
