What's a now page? It's what I'm up to right now.

** ü•ï Health
I'm in my early 30s and I think my top focus for the rest of my life should be health and longevity. Most of the influence in this space comes from two sources:
*** How not to die
The website [[https://nutritionfacts.org/][nutritionfacts.org]] is the biggest influence. A doctor reviews nutrition and medical journals and distills the findings into content for regular people. tl;dr ... eat whole food plant based and your chance of dying from virtually every major risk factor decreases. I bought [[https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-die-cookbook/][the cookbook]] and have been trying to make that a majority of my diet. I'm still regularly consuming dairy and eggs but consumption is trending down.

I'm still harboring a fantasy of quitting tech and becoming a farmer.
