## Notes

On 2026-01-31, capture the AI-output critique and the follow-up clarifying questions needed to reposition the resume around agentic instruction standards, evaluation harnesses (browser emulation + screenshots), and org-wide adoption/enablement work. Questions to answer for resume positioning: what problem the AGENTS.md instruction-seed work solved, who used it, and what changed as a result; what specific evaluation workflows were built and the scale they run at; how those evals increased autonomy or reduced human review; the adoption audience size, cadence, and measurable outcomes; any compliance or auditability improvements tied to this work; concrete impact metrics (time saved, QA reduction, incident reduction, reliability); the tooling stack and CI/logging integration; ownership model and cross-team collaboration; which personal projects best demonstrate this work and whether they are public; and the target role titles to optimize for.
