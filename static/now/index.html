<h2 id="making">Making üèóÔ∏è</h2>
<p>These are projects that I'm working on or intend to work on soon.</p>
<h3 id="gleanmo">Gleanmo</h3>
<p>Clojure based web app for capturing and visualizing different aspects
of life. Habits, exercise, time are the first things I'm building out.
<a href="https://github.com/jgoodhcg/gleanmo">Githu repo.</a></p>
<h3 id="games">Games</h3>
<p>I haven't really started anything in this space but my goals are to
explore different tech stacks. I'd like to make some simple games like
pictionary and family fued with web technologies like Nextjs, Expo,
Rails, and Django. Then I'd like to get deeper into real game
development with Godot and Bevy. Hopefully when I'm done with the simple
games I'll have a decent understanding of more web and game frameworks
as well as new languages.</p>
<p>Then I will try and build a dream game in either Godot or Bevy.</p>
<h3 id="garden">Garden</h3>
<p>I think monoculture grass yards should not exist. Our greenspaces
should try to elevate biodiversity. Food production should also shift
from centralized factory production to decentralized local
production.</p>
<p>I've converted my entire front and back yard into a growing space for
fruits, vegetables, and flowers. I've been in my current house for three
growing seasons and the space is evolving as I learn from experience and
from consuming content.</p>
<p>My main goal for the upcoming 2024 season is to eradicate perennial
grasses by using ground cover the whole growing season. This limits
growing to fabric pots on top of the ground cover until next season.</p>
<h2 id="curating">Curating üìö</h2>
<p>Interesting things worth sharing.</p>
<h3 id="health">Health ü•¶</h3>
<p>I'm in my early 30s and I'm thinking about health and longevity
often. These are two sources of content that are impacting my thinking
the most:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/">Nutritionfacts.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest influence on my health choices. A doctor reviews
nutrition and medical journals and distills the findings into content
for regular people. tl;dr ‚Ä¶ eat whole food plant based and your chance
of dying from virtually every major risk factor decreases. I bought <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-die-cookbook/">the
cookbook</a> and have been trying to make that a majority of my diet.
I'm still regularly consuming dairy and eggs but consumption is trending
down.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/">Bryan Johnson's
blueprint protocol</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A tech bro celebrity with a quantitative measured approach to
anti-aging. I've been watching all the content he puts out about the
Blueprint protocol since I found out about it. I've adopted some aspects
of it into my own diet and exercise. I'm not fully on board with his
brand but I'm interested in the approach.</p>
<h3 id="farming">Farming</h3>
<p>I'm still harboring a fantasy of quitting tech and becoming a
farmer.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/REDGardens">Red Gardens</a></li>
</ul>
<p>High signal quantitative and qualitative analysis of multiple
gardening techniques in Ireland.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCznk4o83WjKFCwEZ8th8wHQ">Edible
Acres</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Consumption thoughtful nursery and composting system in New York
state.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLhu5JoRWPgEGDoUFfQHTPQ/videos">No
till growers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>High production value no-till related.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.notillgrowers.com/the-composter">The
Composter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A podcast interviewing different <em>high quality compost</em>
operations.</p>
<h3 id="wantrepreneur">Wantrepreneur</h3>
<p>Since I started writing software professionally I've consumed
entrepreneur content. This is the stuff I like the most.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.startuptolast.com/">Startup to Last</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My favorite &quot;two people talking&quot; show about <em>bootstrappy</em> tech
companies. I listen to a few shows like this ‚Äì too many to list here. So
I'll just mention this one. I think these two most align with my values
and are just constantly talking about things I find interesting.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcasts">Indie
Hackers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Courtland is a really good podcast host. Early episodes are interview
style. I've listened to each episode two or three times. Later episodes
are more conversational. This is just a good resource to get immersed
and have the basics reiterated over and over.</p>
<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>I'm becoming more interested in urbanism and climate change and I
like these sources of information.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CityNerd">City Nerd</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The common themes are walkability, density, and public
transportation. Lots of deadpan humor and sarcasm. Also deep
quantitative dives and qualitative first hand accounts of experiences
across cities in the United States.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNZYWyBGJ1GLPmb55WQAln2Q7rZn5AFX">PBS
Terra - Weathered</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Non alarmist, but still alarming, generally accessible explanations
of climate change topics. I watch these to feel better about living in
the midwest.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.urbangr.org">Urban GR</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A site about engaging in urban planning for the city I live in.
Really great resource for how developments happen and god commentary on
what makes a livable city.</p>
