# Stylized RSS Page

## Problem / Intent

The RSS page (`/rss.xml` usually, but maybe we want a human-readable landing page for it?) or just styling the feed itself? Transistor.fm has nice RSS pages.

## Constraints

None currently.

## Proposed Approach

- Create a human-friendly landing page at `/rss` or styled XSLT for the XML file?
- If `transistor.fm` style implies a "Subscribe" page with copy-paste links and maybe recent items preview.

## Open Questions

- Are we styling the XML output (XSLT) or creating a helper HTML page?
