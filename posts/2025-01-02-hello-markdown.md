# Welcome to Markdown

This is a test post to verify the markdown-based site generator is working correctly.

## Features

- YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Pandoc for HTML conversion
- Hiccup templates
- Tailwind CSS styling (standalone binary)

## Code Example

```clojure
(defn hello [name]
  (println (str "Hello, " name "!")))
```

## Next Steps

1. Convert existing org-mode posts to markdown
2. Update the now page
3. Customize templates as needed
