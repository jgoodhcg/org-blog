As a full stack software engineer, I have a diverse range of interests and skills. My professional experience mainly revolves around web applications and mobile development using React Native on Expo, with a focus on writing Clojure code. When I step away from the keyboard, I enjoy transforming my lawn into a food forest and a biodiversity haven, doodling cartoons, delving into sci-fi novels, and immersing myself in ancient history and anthropology through audio-books. I care about addressing the climate crisis, promoting socialism, advocating for abolition, and advancing longevity research. Welcome to my website, where I share my work, interests, and the values. </p></div><footer></footer></body></html>
