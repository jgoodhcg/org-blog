# Stylized RSS Page

## Work Unit Summary

- **Status:** planned
- **Problem/Intent:** The RSS page (`/rss.xml` usually, but maybe we want a human-readable landing page for it?) or just styling the feed itself? Transistor.fm has nice RSS pages.
- **Proposed Approach:**
    - Create a human-friendly landing page at `/rss` or styled XSLT for the XML file?
    - If `transistor.fm` style implies a "Subscribe" page with copy-paste links and maybe recent items preview.
- **Open Questions:**
    - Are we styling the XML output (XSLT) or creating a helper HTML page?
