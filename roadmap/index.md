# Roadmap

## Current Focus

Clarifying scope for draft work units before promotion to ready.

## Status Summary

| Status | Count | Units |
|--------|-------|-------|
| draft | 4 | rss-page-style, now-page-update, blogroll-and-discovery, nextjournal-clerk |
| ready | 0 | — |

## Work Units

See individual `*.md` files in this directory. Use `draft` while clarifying and `ready` when autonomous execution can begin.

## Quick Ideas

Ideas not yet promoted to work units:

- AI content discovery — Allow AI to read blog content and provide guidance on surfacing posts to consumers.
